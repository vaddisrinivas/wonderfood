## App factory goal

WonderFood should let one person create many useful apps by editing package/config files, not by writing bespoke React screens.

V1 target:

- schemas
- views
- actions
- widgets
- native capability declarations
- provider bindings
- theme tokens
- AI/package edit proposals

## Still not done

- Full AI package editor inside the app.
- Rich Notion/Linear-quality widget interactions.
- Magical OAuth/share/invite provider UX.
- Complete declarative native permission runtime.
- More app-package examples beyond food/health/plants.
