## Relation views

- Recipe uses ingredient and food item
- Meal plan plans recipe and creates shopping demand
- Shopping demand explains shopping item
- Purchase line fulfills shopping item and creates inventory lot
- Inventory movement moves lot and can be caused by meal log
- Nutrition observation describes meal log using nutrition profile
- Source record supports every citable record

## Buttons

- **Plan dinner from pantry** on Food: Create meal plan draft from use-first kitchen items
- **Add receipt** on Purchases: Create purchase, purchase lines, unmatched review rows and lot candidates
- **Log cooked** on Meal page: Create meal log and inventory movement candidates
- **Build shopping list** on Shopping: Create shopping demands from planned meals and missing ingredients

## Template health

- Confirm all databases include stable `_ID` / `id` fields.
- Confirm source snapshot fields exist before enabling sync.
- Confirm Notion buttons do not hide required review steps.
- Confirm `@now` style dates remain dynamic after duplication.
